          <p id = "longer">
            We became aware of Alexis Williams through a chapter member’s connection with the local high
            school guidance counselor. In our initial meeting with her we were quickly captivated by this self-
            proclaimed “girly-girl who loves STEM” and her enthusiasm for life, her desire to change the world, and
            the numerous projects she is working on to make change happen.
            <br><br>
            Alexis is making a positive impact in her school both academically, through her challenging coursework
            and mentoring of underclassmen, and socially, a vivacious
            captain of the cheerleading squad, an inspirational leader in the Young Progressives Club and a
            persuasive participant in the Mock Trial competitions. She is active in the local community
            participating in her church’s youth group, music program, and is a Voter Registration
            activist. But perhaps her most impressive work encompasses her school and local communities as well
            as the wider world. She is making it her life mission to develop social media platforms to amplify the
            voices of minorities, to create space for positive and uplifting conversation about marginalized
            communities, and to inspire others – especially girls and women – to reach for the stars and not let
            outside voices limit what they can achieve.
            <br><br>
            Alexis is clearly driven, bright, well-spoken, energetic, enthusiastic, accomplished, inspiring, and one of
            the most well-rounded young women we have interviewed. Her projects and accomplishments in the
            world of coding are numerous and impressive, and her ability to merge her tech skills with a talent for
            writing and a flair for design is rare. She modestly talked about being published in Teen Vogue, being
            recognized by Apple who flew her to California for a worldwide developers conference, and being
            asked to speak on philanthropy at a Town &amp; Country Summit. She is forward thinking and carries
            herself with professionalism beyond her years. Though her interests are diverse (from poetry to
            fashion to gymnastics to computer science...) she is focused and organized and able to speak to any
            topic intelligently.
            <br><br>
            Perhaps what sets Alexis apart from the other candidates is her depth of her passion. She believes so
            strongly in the work that she is doing to make changes in our society, its stereotypes, and bias in the
            workplace and media that at one point in the interview, she, and then we, had tears in our eyes. It is
            this passion that will drive her to succeed even when face with adversity; draw the attention of others
            to her cause, and inspire those who come in contact with her to be better people both personally and
            professionally.
