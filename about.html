      <p id = "meTXT">Hi! I'm Alexis, a 19 (almost 20 which is terrifying) year old creative and engineering student at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York University. I'm an Integrated Digital Media major concentrating in Computer Science and Web Developement with an interest in sound engineering. </p> 

      

      <p id = "meTXT"> Lele Genevieve is an alias I created in 11th grade when trying to come up with a nickname for the CPR doll I was assigned at school. It then became my first Tik Tok username and has stuck since. Now I post Tik Toks on the daily, and I'm pretty sure everyone thinks my name is Lele (or Genevieve). Over one year I've amassed 165k+ followers and 5M+ likes making videos about being Black, pursuing STEM, and everything in between. </p>

     

      <p id = "meTXT"> I'm not sure what exactly I want to do in the future, but the dedication I put towards whatever I'm working on is what makes me such a hardworking and passionate individual. My interests in the arts from in front of the camera to behind, and my education in engineering gives me a unique perspective as a potential collaborator. </p>
