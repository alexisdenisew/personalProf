    <p>when i was first introduced to coding i was immediately excited by the practice, but for a while i couldn’t see
      the totality of the subject beyond zeros and ones. it felt like a space that was very mathematical and analytical.
      as someone who is excited by the social world and completely obsessed with my own creative flair, i wasn’t sure if
      computer programming would be the space for me full-time. </p>

    <p> during the summer of 2020 as i watched black lives matter protests erupt all over the nation, i
      was itching to get involved but didn’t know how i could do anything impactful from my living room. i was
      always told that coding is a tool to be used as the ultimate problem solver, so i whipped out my computer and
      thought i’d give it a try. i ended up building a website called pb-resources, which stands for police
      brutality resources. </p>

    <p>at its origin, it’s a web based toolkit i built to make it easier for people to get involved in
      the fight for social justice from home. it pools resources from across the web centered around three ideas:
      education, action, and aid. some of the tools on the website include an auto-generated email sender to
      contact elected officials and a glossary of common terms that appear during conversation about equal justice
      and black lives. the website has reached over two million users, and it has allowed me to work with companies
      like goop, teen vogue, and meta to build their community missions around social justice action items. </p>

    <p>over the years i’ve been able to further my skills in building web environments for social good
      more and more. now, my websites reflect my passion in a wide range of creative disciplines like graphic
      design, audio, and video, and displays my broader understanding of what programming and development can be: a
      place where the analytical and creative collide. another project of mine that exemplifies this passion for the
      collision of innovation and tech is softwear by lex.</p>

    <p>softwear by lex is a groundbreaking sustainable brand that brings together traditionally masculine and feminine
      practices to create interactive, 3d, and upcycled pieces. founded in 2023 by alexis williams, softwear by lex is
      the perfect marriage of williams' interests in stem and fashion. williams uses microcontrollers, custom 3d printed
      pieces, and recycled tech to create pieces that often feature a dash of social commentary.</p>

    <p>as a multi-hyphenate creative i hone in on all of my skills to build projects that are not only
      beautiful and impactful, but effective. i hope to continue creating in the web and audio-visual spaces in the
      future to generate immersive experiences that force us to consider the diverse perspectives of the world around
      us.</p>
