      <p id = "plaque"> Pictured here is Rosalia for the iconic WAP video. She is accessorized in a braided hair do that replicates and manipulates the Spanish Bullfighter's hat in a modern context. Here she is bringing the traditional bull fighting art form into a new space with a completley different sense purpose and importance.</p>

      <p id = "plaque"> Pictured here is Beyonce and Jay-Z for their video Apeshit. In the entire video, they are using the art pieces around the Lourve to make a point about culture and society with sound and image. Using these pieces in this way creates a heightened awarness around Blackness (or lack thereof) in the traditional art space, that would not have been so outwardly highlighted otherwise. </p>

      <p id = "plaque"> Pictured here is Lana del Rey, Jared Leto, and Alessandro Michele dressed in Gucci ensembles with heavy religious tones for the Met Gala, Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination. Without deep interrogation we view such events as a way to celebrate Art, Celebrity and Fashion, but looking deeper we can think about what images like these mean as far as using art as a mode to drive capitalism and make note on class. </p>
